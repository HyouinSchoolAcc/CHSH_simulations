shot noise 
loss 

Procedures:
1. Generate matrix 10000 times
2. Calculate optimal CHSH inequailty of this matrix
3. Use a convolutional net to predict the best output value depending on the matrix
    Goal: predict the optimal CHSH value of an arbitrary density matrix

1. Genereate arbitrary density matrix
2. Write a function that calculates CHSH based on a set of angles
3. Using 20 randomly chosen angles, generate 20 CHSH values
4. Using these 20 CHSH outputs and the corresponding angles to form a nerual network
    Goal: generatelize a 20 measurement protocol for maxim CHSH estimation

1. Introduce noise to the density matrix
2. Using the density matrix, and the noise, to catagorize the noise after computing its CHSH.
